# Online Learning Platform (OLP) - MERN Stack Application

This is a full-stack Online Learning Platform (OLP) application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The OLP allows students to enroll in courses, view content, and track progress. Teachers can manage courses, and administrators have access to user and course management functionalities.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main folders:
- `frontend/` - Contains the front-end React code for the OLP application.
  - `src/assets/Images` - Stores images used in the frontend.
  - `src/components/admin` - Contains components for admin functionalities.
  - `src/components/common` - Contains common components like login, dashboard, and navbar.
  - `src/components/user/student` - Contains components for student-specific views.
  - `src/components/user/teacher` - Contains components for teacher-specific views.

- `backend/` - Contains the back-end Node.js and Express code for the OLP.
  - `config/` - Database configuration.
  - `controllers/` - Contains controllers for admin and user operations.
  - `middlewares/` - Authentication middleware.
  - `routers/` - Contains route definitions for admin and user routes.
  - `schemas/` - Mongoose schemas for database models.
  - `uploads/` - Stores uploaded files (e.g., course materials).
